## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/issues/new).

### Any contributions you make will be under the BSD-3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [BSD-3 License](LICENSE.TXT) that covers the project.

### Match the existing code style

Particularly:

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
* braces required for everything except single line `if`s, and opening braces are not on a new line.
