/** \file cond.h
 *  \defgroup cond cond
 *  \ingroup pico_sync
 * \brief Condition variable API for non IRQ mutual exclusion between cores
 *
 * Condition variables complement mutexes by providing a way to atomically
 * wait and release a held mutex. Then, the task on the other core can signal
 * the variable, which ends the wait. Often, the other core would also hold
 * the shared mutex, so the signaled task waits until the mutex is released.
 * In this implementation, the signaling core does not need to hold the mutex.
 *
 * The implementation is compatible with more than two cores, with the following
 * effects:
 * - there could be a race condition if two cores try to signal at the same
 * time (this would be solved by having them hold a shared mutex when signaling)
 * - every core that waits should wait using the same mutex. There is an
 * assert if this is not the case.
 * - broadcast is implemented and releases every waiting cores.
 *
 * The condition variables only work with non-recursive mutexes.
 *
 * Limitations of mutexes also apply to condition variables. See \ref mutex.h
